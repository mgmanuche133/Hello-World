# Hello-World
My first GitHub Repository

Sup friends!

My name is Mike (aka @its_NUCCI on twitter). I wrestled at Ohio State and have recently taken an interest in coding. My friend Joe turned me on to freecodecamp.com and I have been exploring it extensively since then. I like learning new things and am currently working on a podcast with Joe and my roommate!
